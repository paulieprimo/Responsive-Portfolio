        <div class="paragraph"><p>My name is Paul and i am new to development.  I graduated from Virginia Tech with a degree in Industrial Design in 2005.  After working construction and building museum exhibits for several years, i made a career change and started working at Cisco Systems.  I now work as a Service Delivery Manager and a member of the Global Escalation Desk.  I am interested in Web Development because i have always loved building!</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am interested in learning to code to advance my current career at Cisco and open up new possibilities as well.  I have a project at work centered around a Life-Cycle Engagement Tool.  This tool will need to be able to intake information from Service Owners that want to bring new applications or services into our support environment.  It will need a multipage front end and a db on the backend for storing engagement info and archiving.</p></div>
